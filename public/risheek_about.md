### hi,

Hi, I'm Risheek — a Senior Data Science Analyst at American Express, soon transitioning into a Manager role.  
  
I’ve spent the past few years working at the intersection of **data, business strategy, and AI**, building systems that drive decisions and measurable impact.  
I’m deeply curious about how intelligence can be automated — from prompt optimization frameworks like DSPy to real-world analytics tools that connect business logic to machine learning.  
I enjoy building things end-to-end: from model experimentation to productization and even frontend demos that make insights accessible.  
  
I’ve also built indie projects like **Downwork** (an Upwork clone), **Restomation** (a restaurant automation app), **Cinstagram** (an Instagram clone), and **Ske-app** (a clothing app). These help me explore design, user experience, and product engineering outside of my day job.  
  
Outside of work: I enjoy walking, deep conversations about tech and strategy, and building ideas that simplify complex systems. You can read my thoughts on my [blog] or find more experiments in my [work] section.  
Connect with me on [LinkedIn] or reach out directly — I’m always up for discussing ideas at the intersection of **data, AI, and indie building**.
