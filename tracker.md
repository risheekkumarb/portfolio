   - Add proper CI/CD, data validation, and versioning
3. **System Design Prep**
   - 10+ ML + normal system design problems  
   - 2+ mock interviews
4. **Networking & Outreach**
   - 5+ informational interviews (track in Notion)
   - Leverage for **referrals**
5. **Open Source**
   - 2+ contributions  
   - Documentation and visibility

**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ All projects scaled + optimized  
- ‚úÖ Resume + portfolio finalized  
- ‚úÖ Applications out + mock interviews done

## üß© Missing / Weak Pieces (to fix)

### 1. Resume + Portfolio Optimization
- Build personal portfolio with sections:
  - About | Projects | Blog | Resume | Tech Stack
- GitHub cleanup (pin top 3 projects)

### 2. Product Depth
- 1 project wrapping an ML model as an **API + frontend**
- 1 project with **monitoring & retraining pipeline**

### 3. ML System Design Early Start
- Start from Goal 2 (not Goal 3)
- 1 problem/week, visualize trade-offs

### 4. Networking & Interview Practice
- Track informational interviews (Notion)
- 1 mock interview/month (Pramp / Interviewing.io)

### 5. Software Engineering Rigour
- Focus on:
  - Modular, testable Python  
  - Logging, CI/CD, Docker  
  - Config management

### 6. Learning Loop
- Every month:
  - üìÑ 1 Research paper  
  - üß† 1 Engineering/system blog  
  - üë£ 1 Career story (MLE journey)
- Post summaries weekly (LinkedIn/Twitter)

### 7. Advanced Topics (FAANG Differentiators)
- **Distributed Computing:** Spark / Ray / Data parallelism  
- **Model Optimization:** ONNX, TensorRT, latency-accuracy tradeoffs  
- **A/B Testing:** Experimentation, metrics design, causality  
- **Cross-functional ML:** Translating business needs ‚Üí ML systems
